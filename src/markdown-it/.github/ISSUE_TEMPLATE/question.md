Note, we have some time constrains, but we always try to help developers, who write plugins. So:

- Please, avoid generic programming questions.
- Avoid questions about markdown. Use CommonMark resources for that https://commonmark.org/.
- If you have issue with plugin - report it to plugin's repo/author.
- Make sure you are familiar with dev docs https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/tree/master/docs, and tried to do something.
- Code samples are welcome.

Also, you may find useful this links (may be someone already solved your problem):

- https://github.com/markdown-it - list of "officially" provided plugins.
- https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:markdown-it-plugin - community-written plugins.
